/**
 * A {@link SerialExecutor} implementation which executes one task at a time

 * <p>
 * 
 * This implementation differs from an {@link Executor} created by
 * {@link Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor()} in that there is not actual
 * thread handling done by {@link SerialExecutor} but instead the processing of
 * the tasks is delegated to an underlying executor that can be shared among
 * many {@link Executor}. <p>
 * 
 * Tasks submitted on a {@link SerialExecutor} will be processed sequentially
 * and in the exact same order in which they were submitted, regardless of the
 * number of threads available in the underlying executor.
